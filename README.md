# Time Series Analysis on S&P 500 Stock Prices (1995-2015)

## ABSTRACT
This project focuses on using univariate time series forecasting methods for the stock market index, Standard & Poor's 500 (abbreviated commonly as S&P 500, which is the notation we will use in this project). We went about the time series analysis was through using R and R studio to both predict and visualize our predictions. Along with the interactivity of plotly through the [ggplot2 package](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) we were able to create stunning visuals that help in understanding which time series forecasting method is most appropriate for your own time series analysis.
